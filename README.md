- Yo, I’m TeapotsAreGreatHats, but you can just call me Teapots.
- I'm interested in making games and cool modpacks
- My main thing I guess is art, so I >try< to take a bit more care not to get stuck on the visuals. Also I'm currently learning GameMaker and I want to get into actual coding.
- Eheh, I'm not the best at team-work :'D.
- You can DM me on Discord, my username is "teapotsaregreathats".
